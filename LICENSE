## MIT License

The following components are licensed under the MIT License:
- `/sdk/` - Client SDK
- `/skill/` - Skill implementations

## Why Multiple Licenses?

- **SDK, Skill & Shared (MIT)**: Maximum flexibility for developers to integrate and build upon
- **Server (AGPL-3.0)**: Ensures server improvements remain open source, preventing proprietary cloud service derivatives

## What's in Shared?

The `/shared` directory (MIT) contains only generic utilities:
- Type definitions (TypeScript interfaces)
- Utility functions (data formatting, validation)
- Constants and enums
- **Does NOT contain** core business logic
